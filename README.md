# LaTeX Style Files

These are my personal LaTeX style files<!--
-->—basically, what has accumulated over the years.
Buyers beware.

The basic structure is like this:

    styles
    ├── externalise.sty   # externalisation settings
    ├── quiver.sty        # interaction with q.uiver.app for commutative diagrams
    ├── style.sty         # the bulk of the style file: commands, packages, …
    ├── tikzit.sty        # interaction with tikzit for string diagrams
    └── tikzit.tikzstyles # arrow styles for tikzit

An example file is provided by means of [example.tex](./example.tex).
